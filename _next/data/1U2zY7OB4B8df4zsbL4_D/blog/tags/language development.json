Some examples of these are my own basic programming language, a low level assemble compiler for a virtual CPU and a query language for a distributed processing engine.</p>\n<p>These projects were mainly designed to practice my ability to solve some difficult string processing problems, esspically in Rust. Most of these attempts focused on the tokenising and building language trees, however, I am taking a on pausing these projects for the time being as I need to do some more work in learning the theory of these components. I have already started to read through the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools\">'Dragon Book'</a>.</p>\n<p>Since I have hit a bit of a wall while trying to design and implement a compiler, I am currently working on building a basic web application template. This template system uses a variety of tools to allow me to get a brand-new idea ready for deployment much quicker. To build it I am using <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\">Next.js</a> for the front-end and API, <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/\">MongoDB</a> for the data storage and <a href=\"https://auth0.com/\">Auth0</a> for user management and authentication.</p>\n<p>I am planning on using this template to build some admin dashboard and similar applications, and currently I have early version of this site available for testing on <strike><a href=\"https://admin.zyrn.dev\">admin.zyrn.dev</a></strike> (removed, contact <a href=\"mailto:mitch@zyrn.dev\">me</a> for a preview if desired). Additionally, during the last month I checked out a lot of other web applications and frameworks, with a significant amount of time used to setup a few different Django projects.</p>\n<p>As always, I look forward to seeing you in a month or so for my next development update!</p>\n"},{"filename":"say-what","preview":"For me, this month has had a big focus on languages, compilers, and eco-systems.\nTo start with I returned and old language project, where I was trying to build a language with no experience, no examples, no textbooks and no idea what was involved.\nThis was a simple implementation of a language wh...","title":"Say What?","date":"2021-01-25","author":"Zyrn","published":true,"tags":["language development","rust","llvm"],"content":"<p>For me, this month has had a big focus on languages, compilers, and eco-systems.\nTo start with I returned and old language project, where I was trying to build a language with no experience, no examples, no textbooks and no idea what was involved.</p>\n<p>This was a simple implementation of a language which I had only barely started lexing.\nThe only thing I can be proud of with that implementation was the fact that I used my own butcher form of EBNF document to define the language's syntax.\nAfter getting a rather ugly lexing system going I realised I had no clue what comes next.</p>\n<p>At this point I started searching for resources online which I could learn from.\nWith some help from a friend I was able to find <a href=\"https://craftinginterpreters.com/\">'Crafting Interpreters'</a> an electronic book by Bob Nystrom (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=munificentbob\">@munificentbob</a>).</p>\n<p>This book is an amazing resource and has allowed me to understand and build a whole language despite having next to no experience beforehand. So far, I have implemented lexing, parsing, a syntax tree, an execution environment and expression and statement evaluation.</p>\n<p>Additionally, while working through this book I have been working on my entirely separate language in Rust where I am working on the parsing phase.\nIdeally, I will be using <a href=\"https://llvm.org/\">LLVM</a> <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/llvm-sys\">wrapper</a> for a compiler backend in list language so I am excited for that as I will get a programming language that might even be usable.</p>\n<p>Until then, wishing you a Happy New Year!</p>\n"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
