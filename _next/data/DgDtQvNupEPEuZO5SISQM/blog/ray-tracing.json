Luckily, this was one of my projects I was able to work with a friend on. Together we worked through an amazing free book by Peter Shirley called <a href=\"https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html\">‘Ray Tracing in One Weekend’</a>. Following this tutorial we got a very simple tracing simulation going in Python in just one weekend as advertised. Once we completed this I did a bunch of renders of various scenes, so here are some final pictures and pictures from development.</p>\n<div class=\"screenshot-image-view\">\n    <img src=\"/images/ray_tracing/ray_collisions.jpg\"/>\n    <img src=\"/images/ray_tracing/scenes.png\"/>\n    <img src=\"/images/ray_tracing/shadows_no_aa.png\"/>\n    <img src=\"/images/ray_tracing/materials_and_aa.png\"/>\n</div>\n<p>The main issue with this version of our ray tracing is it was very slow so I have just started to work on an implementation for the browser using WebGL to get utilize GPU compute for this expensive workload.\n<br/> (Reminder you can open the images to get a full size render)</p>\n<p>Once again stay tuned for next month’s update!</p>\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
