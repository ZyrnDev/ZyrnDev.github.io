After using the basic features I started learning how to use docker compose to build complex projects which could be set up on a new computer in minutes. This allows for very simple horizonal scaling applications, my first one of these was to get a <a href=\"https://www.mysql.com/\">MySQL</a> database running with <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/\">Express.js</a> web server which could send me simple reminder through a messaging platform called <a href=\"https://discord.com/\">Discord</a> using a API wrapper called <a href=\"https://discord.js.org/\">Discord.js</a>.</p>\n<p>My goal for this project was to be able to set and send reminders for myself of when I should go to bed, along with other reminders I or my friends might need.\nI was able to get a base application and framework setup, but lost interest on this after I built out the initial features.\nFollowing this I worked on a bunch of little programs, the most notable of the bunch being a parser/lexer in Rust for my langauge, a project I have talked about previously on this blog.</p>\n<p>All in all, this was a pretty light month for my hobby projects, but I was able to learn some key skills in using Docker.</p>\n<p>Can't wait to show you what I do next month!</p>\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
