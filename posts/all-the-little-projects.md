Since my last update I haven't made all too much that I wanted to share, but I still wanted to share my month with you.

I have continued to work with ray tracing and WebGL but I have sort of lost a bit of my motivation so I will be putting that project on hold.
This has kind of been the theme of the last month, starting a project losing interest and starting something else.

After pressing pause on ray tracing I started to learn about a containerisation tool called <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>. After using the basic features I started learning how to use docker compose to build complex projects which could be set up on a new computer in minutes. This allows for very simple horizonal scaling applications, my first one of these was to get a <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> database running with <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a> web server which could send me simple reminder through a messaging platform called <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> using a API wrapper called <a href="https://discord.js.org/">Discord.js</a>. 

My goal for this project was to be able to set and send reminders for myself of when I should go to bed, along with other reminders I or my friends might need.
I was able to get a base application and framework setup, but lost interest on this after I built out the initial features.
Following this I worked on a bunch of little programs, the most notable of the bunch being a parser/lexer in Rust for my langauge, a project I have talked about previously on this blog.

All in all, this was a pretty light month for my hobby projects, but I was able to learn some key skills in using Docker.

Can't wait to show you what I do next month!
