I've got a lot to talk about this month, so appologies if this one turns into a bit more of a read.

- jamduo / jamduo.org founded
- habits (flutter, hasura + graphql, pipelines, relays and more)
- spacefrog a trip with lua (love2d) and C++ (raylib)
- zyrn.dev - removed appleboy's ssh stuff, updated pipelines, updated deps, expanded my markdown options, restyled + desktop stuff
