Over the last month I have been working on a lot more offline projects specifically, I have been working on lexical analysis engines for a different use cases. Some examples of these are my own basic programming language, a low level assemble compiler for a virtual CPU and a query language for a distributed processing engine.

These projects were mainly designed to practice my ability to solve some difficult string processing problems, esspically in Rust. Most of these attempts focused on the tokenising and building language trees, however, I am taking a on pausing these projects for the time being as I need to do some more work in learning the theory of these components. I have already started to read through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools">'Dragon Book'</a>.

Since I have hit a bit of a wall while trying to design and implement a compiler, I am currently working on building a basic web application template. This template system uses a variety of tools to allow me to get a brand-new idea ready for deployment much quicker. To build it I am using <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> for the front-end and API, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> for the data storage and <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> for user management and authentication.

I am planning on using this template to build some admin dashboard and similar applications, and currently I have early version of this site available for testing on <strike><a href="https://admin.zyrn.dev">admin.zyrn.dev</a></strike> (removed, contact <a href="mailto:mitch@zyrn.dev">me</a> for a preview if desired). Additionally, during the last month I checked out a lot of other web applications and frameworks, with a significant amount of time used to setup a few different Django projects.

As always, I look forward to seeing you in a month or so for my next development update!
